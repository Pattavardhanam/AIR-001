# Task 3 : Using ROS and Companion Board

## Objective

In this task, we will add a camera, LIDAR, or IR sensor to the drone and attach it to the companion board. We will send the data from these sensors to implement an AI model. The task will be implemented in two parts:

### Part 1: Sensor Setup

1. **Install Sensors:** Attach a camera, LIDAR, or IR sensor to the drone.
2. **Data Publication:** Set up the sensors to provide real-time data that can be published and subscribed to based on our code.
3. **Verification:** Ensure the code is able to successfully publish and subscribe to the sensor data.

### Part 2: Computation on the Companion Board

1. **Computation Setup:** Use the companion board to process and compute the sensor data.
2. **Hardware Selection:**
   - If the computation is lightweight, use a Raspberry Pi board.
   - If the computation is complex, use the Jetson Nano board available in Marvel.

## Expected Outcomes

- **ROS Proficiency:** Learn how to use ROS to subscribe and publish data.
- **Telemetry Utilization:** Use telemetry to gather data and compute it on the companion board.
- **Companion Board Computation:** Perform computations based on the real-time data.

### Software Requirements

- **ROS (Robot Operating System):** A framework for robot software development.
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu is recommended with Gazebo software.

## Rule of the Sky : Implementing Drone Regulations Using ROS

## Objective

Create a Gazebo simulation that simulates a head-on collision between two drones, where they detect each other and avoid collision according to regulations. The goal is to employ ROS programming to ensure drone operations conform to regulatory guidelines.

### Importance

- **Pedagogical Tool:** This approach serves as a pedagogical tool for learning ROS while reinforcing adherence to pertinent drone regulations.
- **Computational Resource Utilization:** It is significant for tasks requiring substantial computational resources and real-time data processing.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** It facilitates a comprehensive understanding and compliance with drone regulations.

### Scenario Example

In scenarios involving simultaneous trajectories of multiple drones, the ROS-coded system mandates specific actions under regulatory mandates. For instance, when two drones approach head-on:

- **Drone 1:** Ascend and veer right.
- **Drone 2:** Descend and veer left.

Such implementations impart regulatory knowledge and enhance technical proficiency in ROS programming.

### Additional Tasks

- **Path Following:** The drone can be programmed to follow a path based on visual markers like roads and traffic flow.

## Expected Outcomes

- **ROS Proficiency:** Gain proficiency in ROS programming.
- **Real-time Data Processing:** Learn to process real-time data.
- **Regulatory Understanding:** Understand drone regulations.

## ROS (Robot Operating System)

ROS is a framework for robot software development. It provides tools and libraries that help create robot applications from reusable software components. Hereâ€™s an overview of ROS 1 and ROS 2, the two main versions:

### ROS 1

- **Established and Widely Used:** ROS 1 has been around for longer and has a vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and tutorials.
- **Master-Slave Architecture:** Uses a central ROS Master to manage communication between nodes (programs) in the system. This can limit scalability.
- **XML-RPC Middleware:** Communication between nodes relies on XML-RPC, which might not be ideal for real-time systems due to potential latency issues.
- **Limited Platform Support:** Primarily supported on Linux-based operating systems.

### ROS 2

- **Designed for Scalability and Performance:** Addresses ROS 1 limitations by utilizing a distributed communication architecture using Data Distribution Service (DDS). This enables better scalability, reliability, and real-time performance.
- **No Central Master:** Nodes discover and communicate directly with each other, eliminating a single point of failure.
- **Richer APIs:** Offers improved APIs with better language support (C++, Python).
- **Multi-Platform Support:** Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows, providing more flexibility for development environments.

## ROS Environment Requirements

The specific requirements for setting up a ROS environment depend on the version you choose (ROS 1 or ROS 2) and your operating system. Here's a general guideline:

- **Operating System:**
  - **ROS 1:** Primarily Linux (Ubuntu is a popular choice).
  - **ROS 2:** Linux, macOS, or Windows.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Both ROS 1 and ROS 2 require dependencies like build tools (e.g., CMake, Python development tools), version control systems (e.g., Git), and libraries (e.g., Python libraries like NumPy).
- **ROS Installation:**
  - Follow the official installation instructions for your chosen ROS version and operating system from the [Robot Operating System website](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation).
