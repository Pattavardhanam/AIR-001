## Task 1 - Flying the Drone using Airblock
Under the supervision of a coordinator, fly the Airblock and learn basic controls. This will be your first
experince flying in this domain. Fly it from one place to the other when its empty and safe, land it safely. 

Resources:

	1. App for airblock: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.makeblock.makeblock&hl=en
	
	2. Guide: chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://download.makeblock.com/AirblockAPP-EN.pdf
 
## Task 2 - Mission Possible
Using UAV, connect the mission planner and FC either by telemetry or wired. Now setup and configure the UAV based on its physical 
feautures and sensors. Now put a geofence around UVCE, so it doesnt go outside and plan a small autonomous flight, with the coordinator.

## Task 3 - Designing Propellors

Design a propellor blade to generate a lift of around 9 newtons. Design both clockwise and counterclockwise blades.Make sure to be mindful of the leading and trailing edge on the blades.Run a simulation on CFD to calculate a detailed report on the same.

## Task 4 - Assembling Drone using Ecalc
Write about different materials to assemble a drone with an empty weight of 800g. State the reason behind material selection and endurance
Now using this calculate the thrust and battery esc and the other materials needed for the drone.

Resources:

	1. Ecalc: its free but only few configurations available: https://www.ecalc.ch/
	
	2. Study notes: to be added by aditya

## Task 5 - REGULATIONS OF DGCA
Learn more about ICAO, SARPS, QCI, BIS, stakeholders and their basic laws.
Go through AIP. There will be a quiz taken by a coordinator
